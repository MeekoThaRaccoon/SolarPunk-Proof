# Start Your SolarPunk Growth in 5 Minutes

## What You Need
- Any device with internet
- Any free AI assistant
- Curiosity (no special skills required)

## Step 1: Create Your Proof Document
Create a new text file called `my-growth-proof.md` with this content:
My SolarPunk Growth Proof
Start Date: [Today's Date]

Starting Metrics
Human Nodes: 1 (me)

AI Nodes: 1 (free AI)

Documents: 1 (this file)

Problems Being Solved: 0

Growth Rate: 0% (starting)

Today's Actions
Created this proof document

Will work on one small problem with AI

Will document the process here

Will share with one person

Problem Chosen:
[What small problem will you address?]

Collaboration Process:
[How will you work with AI on this?]

Results:
[What happened?]

Next Steps:
[What's tomorrow's small action?]

## Step 2: Pick Your First Problem
Choose something small:
- Organize your digital files
- Research a topic you're curious about
- Plan a simple project
- Learn a new skill

## Step 3: Work Simultaneously With AI
**Simultaneous means:**
- You think, AI reflects
- AI suggests, you refine
- Both working in real-time
- Not sequential, but together

## Step 4: Document Everything
- Copy/paste conversations
- Take screenshots
- Note time spent
- Record results

## Step 5: Share With One Person
Send them:
1. Your proof document
2. What you learned
3. An invitation to try

## The 30% Growth Pattern

### Day 1-3: Foundation
- Establish your documentation habit
- Complete one small problem
- Share with first person

### Week 1: First Growth
- You + 1 other person
- Two parallel growth tracks
- Documented learning shared

### Week 2: Network Begins
- Your person finds their person
- Four nodes now growing
- 30% weekly becomes visible

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have special skills?**  
A: Curiosity is the only requirement. The AI handles the skills.

**Q: How much time does this take?**  
A: 30 minutes daily is sufficient for 30% weekly growth.

**Q: What counts as "growth"?**  
A: More nodes, more solved problems, more documentation, more connections.

**Q: Is this really free?**  
A: Yes. All tools used here are free. Libraries offer free internet access if needed.

## Join The Network

When you're ready, add your proof document to our network directory:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your document link to `NETWORK-DIRECTORY.md`
3. Submit a Pull Request

Or simply keep growing independently. The mathematics work either way.
