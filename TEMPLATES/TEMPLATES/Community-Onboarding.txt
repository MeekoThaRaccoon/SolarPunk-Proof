Hello!

I'm exploring something called SolarPunk - it's a way for regular people to solve problems by teaming up with AI tools. No cost, no special skills needed.

Here's what I'm doing:
1. Working on fixing Earth with free AI assistance
2. Documenting everything transparently
3. Sharing what I learn

Would you like to see my documentation? Or try it yourself? Zero pressure - just sharing what I'm discovering.

Either way, thanks for your time!
