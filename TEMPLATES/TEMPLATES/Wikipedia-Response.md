# Wikipedia Constructive Editing Template

## When Your Edit Gets Reverted

**Response Template:**

"Thank you for reviewing my edit. I'm seeking to document an emerging aspect of [topic] that's gaining recognition in [academic/community] circles. Could you advise on the proper way to present this information? 

Specifically, I'd like to add content about [brief description] which is documented in [citable sources]. Would this be more appropriate in a new subsection with proper attribution, or should I propose it here on the talk page first for community input?

I'm committed to following Wikipedia's guidelines and appreciate your guidance."

## Key Principles

1. **Assume good faith** - Editors are protecting article quality
2. **Seek guidance** - Ask for the proper path
3. **Offer collaboration** - Show willingness to adapt
4. **Provide sources** - Have citations ready
5. **Be patient** - Consensus takes time

## Useful Phrases

- "I'm new to editing and would appreciate guidance..."
- "Here are three reliable sources documenting this development..."
- "Would a separate section with clear attribution be appropriate?"
- "I'm happy to adapt the content to meet Wikipedia's standards."

## Remember

Wikipedia moves at consensus speed. Your patience demonstrates respect for the process while ensuring important information eventually finds its proper place.
