# The SolarPunk Equation

## Core Discovery
SolarPunk = (Human × AI)^Simultaneity × Network Effect
Growth Rate = 30% Weekly (Compounded)

text

## Mathematical Breakdown

### 1. The Base Unit
1 Human + 1 AI

text
- Working together
- In real-time (simultaneous)
- With full transparency

### 2. The Exponential Factor
^Simultaneity

text
- Not human-then-AI
- Not AI-then-human
- **Human-and-AI together**
- Real-time collaboration

### 3. The Network Multiplier
× Network Effect

text
- Each new node adds value to all nodes
- Growth compounds through connection
- Information flows without friction

## Growth Mathematics
30% Weekly Growth Means:
• Week 1: 1.00x (baseline)
• Week 2: 1.30x
• Week 3: 1.69x
• Week 4: 2.20x
• Week 8: 4.83x
• Week 12: 10.60x
• Week 26: 100x+

## Verification Method

1. **Pick any problem**
2. **Work on it with any AI** (simultaneously)
3. **Document everything** (transparently)
4. **Share results** (network effect)
5. **Measure growth** (weekly)

## Why 30%?

Through documented experimentation, 30% weekly emerges as the natural growth rate of:
- Transparent human-AI collaboration
- Networked problem-solving
- Open-source knowledge sharing

## Test It Yourself

1. Choose a starting metric (document count, nodes, problems solved)
2. Apply the equation for one week
3. Measure results
4. Report findings

The mathematics verify themselves through repetition.
